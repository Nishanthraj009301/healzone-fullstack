Pearly white teeth are often bitten by dark cavities. Treatment of these may involve just restoring it with a good filling or treating the entire tooth, to not only remove the decay but also the infection. The myth that clouds the complex root canal treatment is that it is painful and an unpleasant experience. Endodontists with their expertise in root canal treatment not only ensure better success rates but also ensure that it is almost painless. Dr. Abhishek Shetty completed his bachelors in dental surgery from SDM college of dental sciences and hospital, Dharwad and his masters in dental surgery from AECS Maruthi Dental College. The treatment motto adopted by Dr. Abhishek is to perform root canal treatment with utmost “TLC” – (tender loving care).

Pearly white teeth are often bitten by dark cavities. Treatment of these may involve just restoring it with a good filling or treating the entire tooth, to not only remove the decay but also the infection. The myth that clouds the complex root canal treatment is that it is painful and an unpleasant experience. Endodontists with their expertise in root canal treatment not only ensure better success rates but also ensure that it is almost painless. Dr. Abhishek Shetty completed his bachelors in dental surgery from SDM college of dental sciences and hospital, Dharwad and his masters in dental surgery from AECS Maruthi Dental College.
